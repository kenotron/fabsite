title: Button
dos:
  - Make sure the label conveys a clear purpose of the button to the user.
  - >-
    Button labels must describe the action the button will perform and should
    include a verb. Use concise, specific, self-explanatory labels, usually a
    single word.
  - >-
    Buttons should always include a noun if there is any room for interpretation
    about what the verb operates on.
  - >-
    Consider the affect localization will have on the button and what will
    happen to components around it.
donts:
  - >-
    Don't use generic labels like "Ok," especially in the case of an error;
    errors are never "Ok."
  - >-
    Don’t place the default focus on a button that destroys data. Instead, place
    the default focus on the button that performs the "safe act" and retains the
    content (i.e. "Save") or cancels the action (i.e. "Cancel").
  - >-
    Don’t use a button to navigate to another place, use a link instead. The
    exception is in a wizard where "Back" and "Next" buttons may be used.
  - >-
    Don’t put too much text in a button - try to keep the length of your text to
    a minimum.
  - Don't put anything other than text in a button.

Buttons are best used to enable a user to commit a change or complete steps in a task. They are typically found inside forms, dialogs, panels or pages. An example of their usage is confirming the deletion of a file in a confirmation dialog.

When considering their place in a layout, contemplate the order in which a user will flow through the UI. As an example, in a form, the individual will need to read and interact with the form fields before submiting the form. Therefore, as a general rule, the button should be placed at the bottom of the UI container (a dialog, panel, or page) which holds the related UI elements.

While buttons can technically be used to navigate a user to another part of the experience, this is not recommended unless that navigation is part of an action or their flow.

Note that both `iconProps` and `menuIconProps` take [`IIconProps`](#/controls/web/icon) to specify icon name and type.

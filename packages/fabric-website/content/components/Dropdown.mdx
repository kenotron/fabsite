overview: >-
  A drop-down menu is a list in which the selected item is always visible, and
  the others are visible on demand by clicking a drop-down button. It’s used to
  simplify the design and make a choice within the UI.

layout: >-
  * Use a drop-down menu when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed
  under one title. Or if the list of items is long or when space is constrained.

  * Use a drop-down when the selected option is more important than the
  alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible
  putting more emphasis on the other options.)
content: |-
  * Use sentence-style capitalization for drop-down menu labels and options.
  * Labels should describe what can be found in the menu.
  * Use shortened statements or single words as menu options.
  * If there isn’t a default option, use “Select an option” as placeholder text.
  * If “None” is an option, include it.
  * Write the choices using parallel construction.

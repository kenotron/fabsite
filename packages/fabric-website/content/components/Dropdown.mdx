title: Dropdown
path: /dropdown
overview: >-
  A drop-down menu is a list in which the selected item is always visible, and
  the others are visible on demand by clicking a drop-down button. It’s used to
  simplify the design and make a choice within the UI.

layout: >-
  * Use a drop-down menu when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed
  under one title. Or if the list of items is long or when space is constrained.

  * Use a drop-down when the selected option is more important than the
  alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible
  putting more emphasis on the other options.)
content: |-
  * Use sentence-style capitalization for drop-down menu labels and options.
  * Labels should describe what can be found in the menu.
  * Use shortened statements or single words as menu options.
  * If there isn’t a default option, use “Select an option” as placeholder text.
  * If “None” is an option, include it.
  * Write the choices using parallel construction.
accessibility: "- Use the `aria-expanded` property to convey expanded and collapsed states to the screen readers.\r\n- Provide a static label to the dropdown.\r\n- Use the `aria-describedy` property to make sure the currently selected option is announced by a screen reader. \r\n- Make sure options are implemented inside a list so that screen readers could announce the position for every option. \r\n- Enter key should expand the dropdown.\r\n- When the dropdown is expanded, pressing Enter would collapse the dropdown and select the current highlighted option.\r\n- Selecting the Up/Down arrow should take the focus to next/prev option respectively.\r\n- Selecting the Home/End key should take the focus to first/last option respectively.\r\n- When the dropdown is collapsed, up/down arrow should expand the dropdown and place the focus on first/last option respectively.\r\n"

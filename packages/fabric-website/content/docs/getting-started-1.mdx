      UI Fabric for the web is available in two flavors: Fabric React and Fabric
      Core.


      ### Fabric React


      Fabric React is the official
      [open-source](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react) React
      front-end framework designed to build experiences that fit seamlessly into
      a broad range of Microsoft products. It provides robust, up-to-date,
      accessible components which are highly customizable using CSS-in-JS. [Get
      started with Fabric React](#fabric-react)


      ### Fabric Core


      Fabric Core is an
      [open-source](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core)
      collection of CSS classes and Sass mixins that give you access to Fabric's
      colors, animations, fonts, icons and grid. [Get started with Fabric
      Core](#fabric-core)


      ### For Designers


      UI Fabric also provides resources to help you [use our design language in
      your site](#use-our-design-language-in-your-site).

      Fabric React provides several starter kit options. Make sure you have the
      [latest LTS Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, then choose one of
      the options below:


      - [Option 1: Quick start](#option-1-quick-start)

      - [Option 2: Using Create React App](#option-2-create-react-app)

      - [Option 3: Using Gatsby.js](#option-3-gatsbyjs)


      ### Option 1: Quick start


      Open a terminal and go to the folder where you want the project created,
      then run:


      ```shell

      npm init uifabric

      ```


      It'll prompt you for a project name. For example, if you call the project
      `my-app`, you can start it like this:


      ```shell

      cd my-app

      npm start

      ```


      Open up the `App.tsx` file and start editing. You'll see your changes in
      the browser seconds after you hit save.


      This scaffold uses the [Just](https://github.com/microsoft/just) build
      library. It is very flexible and requires no "eject" script to allow
      customizing configuration.


      ### Option 2: Create React App


      UI Fabric also provides a starter using [Create React
      App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/), a popular development
      stack maintained by the creators of React.


      Open a terminal, go to an appropriate folder, and clone the [starter
      repo](https://github.com/microsoft/create-react-app-uifabric):


      ```shell

      git clone https://github.com/microsoft/create-react-app-uifabric.git
      my-app

      cd my-app

      ```


      Then install dependencies and start the app like this:


      ```shell

      # with npm (default)

      npm install

      npm start


      # with yarn (optional)

      yarn

      yarn start

      ```


      ### Option 3: Gatsby.js


      To start creating a blazing fast static website or app using UI Fabric and
      [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), run the following in a terminal:


      ```shell

      npm install -g gatsby-cli

      gatsby new gatsby-site kenotron/gatsby-starter-uifabric

      cd gatsby-site

      gatsby develop

      ```


      This app be deployed to the cloud in one clickâ€”[learn more

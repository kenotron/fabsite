  - copy: "UI Fabric for the web is available in two flavors: Fabric React and Fabric Core.\r\n\r\n### Fabric React\r\n\r\nFabric React is the official [open-source](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react) React front-end framework designed to build experiences that fit seamlessly into a broad range of Microsoft products. It provides robust, up-to-date, accessible components which are highly customizable using CSS-in-JS. [Get started with Fabric React](#fabric-react)\r\n\r\n### Fabric Core\r\n\r\nFabric Core is an [open-source](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core) collection of CSS classes and Sass mixins that give you access to Fabric's colors, animations, fonts, icons and grid. [Get started with Fabric Core](#fabric-core)\r\n\r\n### For Designers\r\n\r\nUI Fabric also provides resources to help you [use our design language in your site](#use-our-design-language-in-your-site).\r\n\r\n## Fabric React\r\n\r\nGetting started developing with Fabric React is simple!\r\n\r\nTo quickly try out Fabric React, you can use our 'Hello World' templates on [CodePen](https://aka.ms/fabricpen) or [CodeSandbox](https://aka.ms/fabricsandbox).\r\n\r\nYou can also add Fabric React to an existing project or use one of our starter kits to create a new project.\r\n\r\n### Add to existing project\r\n\r\nFabric React is available via the `office-ui-fabric-react` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/office-ui-fabric-react). To use this package in an existing project:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# with npm\r\nnpm install office-ui-fabric-react\r\n\r\n# with yarn\r\nyarn add office-ui-fabric-react\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { PrimaryButton } from \"office-ui-fabric-react\";\r\n```"
    name: Overview
  - copy: "Fabric React provides several starter kit options. Make sure you have the [latest LTS Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, then choose one of the options below:\r\n\r\n- [Option 1: Quick start](#option-1-quick-start)\r\n- [Option 2: Using Create React App](#option-2-create-react-app)\r\n- [Option 3: Using Gatsby.js](#option-3-gatsbyjs)\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Quick start\r\n\r\nOpen a terminal and go to the folder where you want the project created, then run:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnpm init uifabric\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'll prompt you for a project name. For example, if you call the project `my-app`, you can start it like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncd my-app\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen up the `App.tsx` file and start editing. You'll see your changes in the browser seconds after you hit save.\r\n\r\nThis scaffold uses the [Just](https://github.com/microsoft/just) build library. It is very flexible and requires no 'eject' script to allow customizing configuration.\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Create React App\r\n\r\nUI Fabric also provides a starter using [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/), a popular development stack maintained by the creators of React.\r\n\r\nOpen a terminal, go to an appropriate folder, and clone the [starter repo](https://github.com/microsoft/create-react-app-uifabric):\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/create-react-app-uifabric.git my-app\r\ncd my-app\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen install dependencies and start the app like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# with npm (default)\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm start\r\n\r\n# with yarn (optional)\r\nyarn\r\nyarn start\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 3: Gatsby.js\r\n\r\nTo start creating a blazing fast static website or app using UI Fabric and [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), run the following in a terminal:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnpm install -g gatsby-cli\r\ngatsby new gatsby-site kenotron/gatsby-starter-uifabric\r\ncd gatsby-site\r\ngatsby develop\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis app be deployed to the cloud in one click—[learn more here](https://github.com/microsoft/gatsby-starter-uifabric#-deploy).\r\n"

    name: Next steps with Fabric React
  - copy: "[Fabric Core](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core) is a collection of CSS classes and Sass mixins that give you access to Fabric's colors, animations, fonts, icons and grid.\r\n\r\n### Who should use Fabric Core\r\n\r\nFabric Core is primarily meant for non-React applications or static pages.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Fabric React, you may not need Fabric Core. Most of the styles from Fabric Core are also available via CSS-in-JS styling, which is the recommended styling approach with Fabric React.\r\n\r\n### Adding Fabric Core to your site\r\n\r\nTo add the latest Fluent version of Fabric Core to your site, link to this CSS file in the `head` of your webpage. (For the pre-Fluent styles, replace `10.0.0` with `9.6.1` in the `href`.)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link\r\n  rel=\"stylesheet\"\r\n  href=\"https://static2.sharepointonline.com/files/fabric/office-ui-fabric-core/10.0.0/css/fabric.min.css\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFabric Core is also available [via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/office-ui-fabric-core) as `office-ui-fabric-core`, or you can [download a copy](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core/releases) to include in your project.\r\n\r\n### Using Fabric Core class names\r\n\r\nTo use the styles, add the `ms-Fabric` class to a containing element to set the `font-family` for all Fabric typography classes used within that element. Then apply the Fabric styles directly to your HTML elements.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"ms-Fabric\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n  <span class=\"ms-font-su ms-fontColor-themePrimary\">Big blue text</span>\r\n</div>\r\n```"

## Overview

ActivityItems represent individual units of a user's activity, such as making a comment, mentioning someone with an @mention, editing a document, or moving a file.

## Do's

- Use a list of multiple ActivityItems to indicate a history of events relating to a single file, folder, user, or other entity. Alternatively, use a single ActivityItem to indicate the most recent event on an entity.
- Group multiple similar events occuring near the same time into single ActivityItems.

## Don'ts

- Use ActivityItems to render large amounts of body text; they are meant to be concise descriptions of a specific activity.
